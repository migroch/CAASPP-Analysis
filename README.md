# CAASPP-Anlysis

**Key findings:**

* Mission Hill consistently does better across all claims and years (largest difference on 2015 for Claim1: Reading )
* Branciforte 8th grade scores are lowest across all claims on 2017
* Parents level of education and a mixture of economic status with ethnicity is what correlates the most with scores
     -  White non-economically disadvantaged students and students with parentsthat have post-graduate education do the best
     -  English learners and economically disadvantaged students do the worst
* Mission has more students than Branciforte in the subgroups that tend to do better, whereas Branciforte has more students than Mission in the subgroups that tend to do worst
* Branciforte has a larger population of economically disadvantaged hispanic/latino students than non-economically disadvantaged white students. Mission has the opposite

The story seems to be that Mission Hill tends to do better across all claims due to its larger population of non-economically disadvantaged students with more educated parents. There is definitely a correlation between scores and ethnicity as well, however this correlation could arise from the correlation between ethnicity and economic status, parent education and english learners.
