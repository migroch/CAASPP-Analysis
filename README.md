# CAASPP-Anlysis

Link to figures: 

Key findings:

* Mission consistently does better across all claims and years (largest difference on 2015 Claim1: Reading )
* Branciforte 8th grade scores are lowest across all claims on 2017
* Parents level of education and a mixture of economic status with ethnicity are the correlate the most with scores
     -  White non-economically disadvantaged and students with 
         parents that have post-graduate education do the best
     -  English learners and economically disadvantaged students do 
         the worst
* Mission has more students than Branciforte in the subgroups that tend to do 
  better, whereas Branciforte has more students than Mission in the 
  subgroups that tend to do worst
* Branciforte's has a larger population of economically disadvantaged 
  hispanic/latino than non-economically disadvantaged white. Mission is the 
  opposite

The story seems to be that Mission tends to do better across all claims due to its larger population of non-economically disadvantaged students with more educated parents. There is definitely a correlation between scores and ethnicity as well, however this correlation could arise from the correlation between ethnicity and economic status, and ethnicity and parent education.
